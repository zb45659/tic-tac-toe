Requirements
Your goal is to build out a working version of Tic-Tac-Toe. This is to get you ready to build out a more complex game for your project so in addition to practicing the technical skills you've learned in class, you'll practice scoping out a large project, breaking it into smaller pieces, and working towards those goals in sequence.

You're going to build out your Tic-Tac-Toe game in two phases! We'll define the goals for each phase, but you should break these down into even smaller steps.

Phase 1: Player-scored Version
Build out a 3x3 grid with clickable squares. When a user clicks on a square, it should turn red or blue (alternating with each click). Once a square has been clicked, a user should not be able to click it again and change it's color. Below your 3x3 grid, you should have a 'reset' button that will reset the game.

Bonus requirements:

Have a message somewhere in your UI to show who the current player is (i.e. red's turn or blue's turn)

Phase 2: Computer-scored Version
Students will often jump straight in to building a complex algorithm to determine if a player has won. While the enthusiasm is great, it's often better to start with a 'player-scored' version and then work towards a 'smart' version.

The goal of this phase is to make it so that players don't have to manually score the game. Instead, you're going to write some code that will check the board with every turn:

If a player has won, display a message with which player won the game (i.e. red or blue)
If all the squares are filled in and no player has won yet, display a message saying it's a tie
In both cases, the users should be able to reset the game
In games where there are a limited number of winning combinations, a great first-step to auto-calculating the winner is to hold those winning combinations in some format (maybe an array) and check the current game against those winning combinations. If one of the winning combinations matches the gameboard, then you know a player has won!

However, doing so requires modeling the current state of the gameboard in your code. So, in addition to updating your UI whenever a player makes a move, you'll also have to update some representation of the gameboard in your game code. -->
